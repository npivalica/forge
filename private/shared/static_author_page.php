  <h2>Nikolina Pivalica 9/17</h2>
  <div id="service-blocks">
    <p>I'm at my final few exams at <a href="https://www.ict.edu.rs/" class="learnmore" target="_blank">ICT College of Vocational Studies</a> where I'm studying Web Programming. This is a project for PHP1 course. </p>
    <p>I love learning new things and pushing myself out of my comfort zone, so I'm furthering my knowledge currently while I'm on a DevOps internship. Like Pokemon, I gotta learn it all!</p>
    <p>I'm an avid epic fantasy lover, cancer survivor, biggest Harry Potter fan you'll meet and a great teammate for trivia nights! </p>
